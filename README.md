1. Launch Tetris at this link:
- [ml-lab-4d78f073-aa49-4f0e-bce2-31e5254052c7.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com:62293](http://ml-lab-4d78f073-aa49-4f0e-bce2-31e5254052c7.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com:62293)

2. You will be prompted to register an account (or log in if you have previously registered); this is in order to keep track of your personal best scores as well as your rankings in the public leaderboard (with your consent).

3. Once registration/log-in is successful, you are free to play. The game mechanics are simple (button:description):
- Left arrow: Moves piece to the left
- Right arrow: Moves piece to the right
- Down arrow: Moves piece down by one block
- Up arrow: Rotates a piece 90 degrees clockwise
- Spacebar: Drops the piece
